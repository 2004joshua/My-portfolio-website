								<p>As I mentioned, my name is Joshua Arrevillaga. I grew up in Lynn, MA, and I am currently a rising junior at Boston University, pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering.</p> 
								<br />

								<p> 
									From a young age, I was fascinated by technology and innovation. I would often dismantle PCs to understand their inner workings or repair my tablet just to see how things fit together. 
									My passion for coding was ignited by Minecraft, which featured a command line interface that allowed the player to further interact with the game. This curiosity led me to enroll in the PLTW engineering 
									courses at my high school, KIPP Academy Lynn Collegiate, where I acquired the fundamentals of engineering and learned to use tools such as AutoCAD Inventor. These experiences solidified my interest in the 
									field and led to my acceptance into Boston University initially as an Electrical Engineering major. However, I soon realized that Computer Engineering was a better fit for my career aspirations and made 
									the switch.
								<br /> 

								<p>
									At Boston University, I have been fortunate to take classes that blend hardware and software development, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of how they work together to create impactful 
									solutions. Through my coursework, I have developed skills in C/C++, Java, Python, and MATLAB, applying them to various assignments and projects. One pivotal moment was my Operating Systems class last 
									spring, which significantly deepened my interest in both hardware and software. Excelling in one of the most challenging computer engineering undergraduate courses boosted my confidence and motivated me 
									to pursue advanced electives before my graduation in June 2026.
								<br />

								<p>
									Outside of academics, I value spending quality time with friends, whether it's playing video games, dining out, or enjoying a game of soccer. To manage stress, I find solace in going to the gym. I'm an avid 
									Celtics fan and proudly celebrate their 2024 championship win. Additionally, I enjoy listening to music and exploring nature through hiking.
